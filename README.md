# Qvandidat



# Installation

Make sure your python version is up to date. The easiest way is to download and install the latest version of Python, then update your packages to the latest version [like this SO article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2720014/how-to-upgrade-all-python-packages-with-pip) because for example QuTip (used by QisKit) isn't compatible with old NumPy versoins (there may be other packages that need to be updated too). But beaware that this may break some of your older python code if it relies on obscure features that are changed/removed in your favourite library (this is why *pros* use anaconda, and *real pros* do not use python). Then just run `pip install qiskit` and `pip install cirq`. That should be all!
